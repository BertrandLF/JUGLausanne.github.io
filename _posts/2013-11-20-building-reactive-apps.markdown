Non-blocking, asynchronous, and reactive programming models are all the rage today. This session will explore in-depth why these patterns are important in modern apps.

We will drill down and see how to apply them to event-driven web, mobile, and RESTful apps. To illustrate the concepts, we will use Java, Scala, Akka, and the Play Framework as examples.
