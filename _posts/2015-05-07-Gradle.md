Are you one of those that search Around the World looking for clues on how to
get maven to do your bidding or do you just toss a coin and Get Lucky One More
Time? Maven works OK but there’s a new tool in town that goes Beyond maven:
Gradle. It’s Fresh, almost Aerodynamic. Once you get in Contact with it you’ll
feel like Doin’ It Right when building a project. We kid you not, it’s an
Instant Crush for those that have followed the maven path. This is The Prime
Time of Your Life as a developer, make the most out of it by leveraging the
best tools. Oh Yeah.
