Spring Boot is a product from Spring, that provides many configuration
defaults for a new Spring project, so that one can set up a project in
minutes. However, this is only one of the many features of Spring Boot. One of
its module also provides many important Non-Functional Requirements
out-of-the-box: monitoring, metrics, exposing those over HTTP, etc. In this
presentation, I'll demo some of those, that will make DevOps more than a
little happy. 
Comments: DevOps that don't know about Spring Boot should. Out-of-the-box
features are priceless and include metrics, healthchecks, and more.
