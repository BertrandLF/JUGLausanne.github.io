Akka Streams is an implementation of Reactive Streams, which is a standard for
asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure on the JVM.

In this talk we'll cover the rationale behind Reactive Streams, and explore
the different building blocks available in Akka Streams.

There will be live coding, and I’ll showcase both the Java8 and Scala API. 
The Reactive Streams momentum has just started, but it’s going to be big! Get
a front seat and be ready to join us on this flowing experience.
